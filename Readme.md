# **bdownloader** is a multi-connection file downloading library with a pause,stop and resume feature.

### Features

* Multi-threaded Downloads: Splits files into chunks and downloads them concurrently for maximum speed.

* Pause & Resume: Gracefully suspend and continue downloadsâ€”even across app restarts.

* Stop & Cancel: Stop downloads at any time, with the option to cancel and remove all partial data.

* Progress Tracking: Real-time progress updates for each file and its chunks.

* Error Handling & Retry Logic: Automatically retries failed chunks to ensure downloads complete smoothly.

* Built-in Support for Large Files: Handles multi-gigabyte files with ease.

* Optimized for Android: Works efficiently across API levels with foreground services and proper lifecycle awareness.


>bdownloader utilizes kotline's coroutine and okhttp.

 val bdownloader = BDownloader(context)

```

### Pause a download request

bdownloader.pause(downloadId);
```

### Resume a download request
```kotlin
bdownloader.resume(downloadId);
```

### Cancel a download request
```kotlin
// Cancel with the download id
bdownloader.cancel(downloadId);
// The tag can be set to any request and then can be used to cancel the request
bdownloader.cancel(downloadId);
// Cancel all the requests
bdownloader.cancelAll();
```

### Status of a download request
```kotlin
val  status = bdownloader.getStatus(downloadId);
```
